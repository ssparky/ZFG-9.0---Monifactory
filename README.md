<h1 align="center">ZFG pack 9.0</h1>
<p></p>
## Short
ZFG pack 9.0 is the latest iteration of the ZFG pack series. This version is built upon the Monifactory modpack, with additions and integrations with mods featured in previous ZFG packs sprinkled in.

## What to expect
In terms of progression, the pack is mostly identical to Monifactory. Most new features are more side-content, to give things to do to those either temporarily bored of tech progression, or those who are not huge fans of tech to begin with.

## Other noteworthy changes
This pack does not feature the difficulty options of Monifactory. The code is based on Monifactory's "Normal" mode, with some of "Hard" mode being available but optional.
Optional compatibilities for mods not already added to ZFG 9.0 have been removed.
